InnSecure --- Totally Secure Room Booking
=========================================

Innsecure provides a JSON API to manage hotel bookings.

## Getting Started
- `make test` will run unit and end-to-end tests 
- `make build` builds the app and token generator (see 'Generating JWTs, below')
- `docker-compose up` builds and spins up the service on port 8080

## Generating JWTs
Authorisation is handled using [JSON Web Tokens](jwt.io). The default service started via Docker Compose uses a simple signing key of `SigningString`. Acquisition of a JWT is outside the scope of this task, but a tool is included to help with generating tokens for testing. `make build` produces a binary at `./bin/token`, which will generate a working JWT for a standard user in hotel `123`. The signing key, hotel ID, and admin status can be overridden using the `-key`, `-hotel`, and `-admin` flags, respectively.

Using the generated token, set the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests to `Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`, e.g. 

```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/hotels/123/bookings' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZSwibmFtZSI6IkguQS4gS2VyciIsIm9yZyI6MTIzLCJzdWIiOiI4NzkwYzUxNC03M2I2LTQwMGYtOGYyOC1hY2M3NGQzNDJhMjIifQ.jEVthaAkJZ2mQ0jNsXH1oSMGcYX1-_mcXcdqkLYZz8Q' \
```

## Endpoints
### Create a Booking
`POST /hotels/:hotelID/bookings`

Using a body like this one:
```
{
    
    "hotel_id":123,
    "type": "Booking",
    "version": 0,
    "arrive": " 2021-08-13",
    "leave": " 2021-08-14",
    "name": "Geoff Capes"
}
```

Bookings can only be created by an admin user. See _Generating JWTs_, above for info on how to create an admin token.
Bookings can only be created in the hotel of the user.

### Fetch a Booking
`GET /hotels/:hotelID/bookings/:bookingID`

Bookings can only be fetched from a user's own hotel.

### List Bookings
`GET /hotels/:hotelID/bookings`

A user can only list bookings from their own hotel.
